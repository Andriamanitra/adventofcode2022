## My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/)

I am mostly using Ruby this year. The primary solution for each day will be
in a file called `solution.rb` inside the directory for that day. These
solutions use a common base (from `lib/base.rb`) that imports some useful
standard libraries by default and monkey patches a few methods. The base
class implements reading input as a string from the `input.txt` (and `example.txt`
if it exists) file, running the solution, and printing/formatting the output.

Some days may include additional implementations in other languages such as
Haskell or whatever else I felt like writing that day.
